### The **ULTIMATE** Desktop Experience for the crazy nerd on Ubuntu Studio 24.04 üòÅ

#### **Why**?

After adding a NAS on my home network, reinstalling an operating system without worrying about backing up data became an incredibly easy and fast task (literally about 20 minutes while having a coffee). The only thing missing was a way of restoring all the settings of my favorite operating system for it to be precisely as it was before the clean install in one single step, hence, this repository.
